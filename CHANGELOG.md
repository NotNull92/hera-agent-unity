# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.3] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **Console `--stacktrace user` filter widened.** Previously only five
  frame patterns were dropped (`UnityEngine.Debug:`, `EditorGUIUtility:`,
  `Unity.Entities.SystemState:`, `(at Library/`, `(at ./Library/`).
  Real-world exception traces leaked the synthetic exec wrapper
  (`__CliDynamic:Execute`), the hera-agent dispatcher itself
  (`HeraAgent.CommandRouter:*`, `HeraAgent.HttpServer:*`), reflection
  machinery (`System.Reflection.MethodBase:Invoke`,
  `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.AsyncTaskMethodBuilder…`), and the
  editor's update pump (`EditorApplication:Internal_CallUpdateFunctions`).
  All seven families now drop in `user` mode; `full` still returns
  everything verbatim.

### Added

- **`list --tool <name>` now includes an `examples` field.** The
  `HeraToolAttribute.Examples` / `ExampleDescriptions` properties
  restored in v0.0.2 were stored on the attribute but never surfaced
  in the schema response. `ToolDiscovery.GetToolSchema()` now zips
  the two arrays index-wise and emits a `[{call, description}, ...]`
  list. The slim `list` (no `--tool`) payload is intentionally
  unchanged — examples are deep-dive material.
- **`exec` schema now advertises `compile_only`, `stacktrace`, and
  `strict`.** These three flags were already wired end-to-end (v0.0.1
  ExecuteCsharp.HandleCommand reads them via `p.GetBool` / `p.Get`),
  but the `Parameters` nested class only declared the v0.0.1 base
  set. Schema-driven consumers (`list --tool exec`) couldn't see
  them. Three `[ToolParameter]` declarations added so the schema
  matches the actual surface.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **UPM package failed to compile** because the merged `HeraToolAttribute`
  was missing `Examples` and `ExampleDescriptions` properties that
  `DescribeType`, `FindMethod`, and `ListAssemblies` reference on their
  `[HeraTool(... Examples = new[] { ... })]` declarations. Adding the two
  properties back to the attribute (carried over from Pro) restores a
  clean Unity import. `ToolDiscovery` does not yet surface the examples
  in tool schemas — that is a future enhancement; v0.0.2 only restores
  the compile path so the CLI side of v0.0.1 becomes actually usable.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-27

Initial release of the unified `hera-agent-unity` — successor to
`hera-agent` (free lite) and `hera-agent-pro` (commercial). All
former Pro features ship free under MIT.

### Added

- Single Go CLI + C# UPM connector bridging Unity Editor over localhost HTTP.
- Built-in tools: `editor`, `exec`, `log`, `scene`, `console`, `test`,
  `menu`, `screenshot`, `profiler`, `reserialize`, `describe_type`,
  `find_method`, `list_assemblies`.
- Auto-discovery via heartbeat files under `~/.hera-agent-unity/instances/`.
- Batch execution (`batch`) for atomic multi-step workflows.
- `[HeraTool]` attribute-based custom tool registration with reflection scan.
- Unity pitfalls catalog surfaced through `describe_type`.
- Asset Config (`asset-config`) TUI + UPM editor window, sharing
  `~/.hera-agent-unity/asset-config.json`.
- Self-install (`install`), self-update (`update`), self-uninstall (`uninstall`),
  and self-diagnostic (`doctor`) commands.
- Cross-platform binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows × amd64/arm64).
